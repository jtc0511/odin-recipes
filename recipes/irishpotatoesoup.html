  <p class="intro"> Irish potato soup, often referred to simply as "potato soup," is a traditional 
    Irish dish known for its simplicity and hearty character. It is a creamy and 
    comforting soup made primarily from potatoes, along with a few other ingredients. 
    The basic recipe typically includes:</p>
    <div class="meatandbones">
  <h2>ingrediants</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4 large potatoes, peeled and diced</li>
    <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
    <li>4 cups chicken or vegetable broth</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>1 cup heavy cream (or milk for a lighter version)</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>Chopped chives or scallions for garnish (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h2>directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Saut√© the Onions: In a large pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and cook until they become translucent and slightly caramelized, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add Potatoes and Broth: Add the diced potatoes to the pot and pour in the chicken or vegetable broth. Bring the mixture to a boil. Once it's boiling, reduce the heat to a simmer, cover the pot, and let it cook for about 15-20 minutes or until the potatoes are tender.</li>
    <li>Blend the Soup: Using an immersion blender or transferring the soup to a regular blender in batches, blend the soup until smooth and creamy.</li>
    <li>Add Cream/Milk: Return the soup to the pot and stir in the heavy cream (or milk if you prefer a lighter soup). Heat the soup over low heat, stirring frequently, until it's heated through but not boiling.</li>
    <li>Season and Serve: Season the soup with salt and pepper to taste. Ladle the hot potato soup into bowls, and garnish with chopped chives or scallions if desired.</li>
    <li>Enjoy: Serve your Irish potato soup hot, with some crusty bread or a slice of Irish soda bread on the side for a traditional and comforting meal.</li>
</ol>
