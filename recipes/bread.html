<h2>ingrediants</h2>
<ul>
  <li>4 cups all-purpose flour (you can also use bread flour for a slightly better texture)</li>
  <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
  <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (1 packet)</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
  <li>1 1/2 cups warm water (around 110째F or 43째C)</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil (or olive oil)</li>
</ul>
<h2>instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Activate the Yeast: In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Stir gently and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. This indicates that the yeast is active.</li>
  <li>Combine Dry Ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and salt.</li>
  <li>Mix Wet and Dry Ingredients: Create a well in the center of the dry ingredients. Pour in the activated yeast mixture and the vegetable oil. Stir everything together with a wooden spoon or a mixer with a dough hook attachment until the dough comes together.</li>
  <li>Knead the Dough: Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Knead the dough for about 8-10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. If it's too sticky, add a little more flour as needed.</li>
  <li>  First Rise: Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm, draft-free place for about 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
  <li>Shape the Loaf: After the first rise, punch down the dough to remove excess air. Shape it into a loaf by rolling it out into a rectangle and then rolling it up tightly. Place the shaped dough into a greased 9x5-inch (23x13 cm) loaf pan.</li>
  <li>Second Rise: Cover the loaf pan with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and allow it to rise again for about 30-45 minutes, or until it's puffed up and reaches just above the rim of the pan.</li>
  <li>Preheat and Bake: Preheat your oven to 375째F (190째C). Once preheated, remove the cover from the loaf pan and bake the bread for 25-30 minutes or until the top is golden brown and the bread sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.</li>
  <li>Cool and Enjoy: Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool in the pan for a few minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and enjoy your homemade bread!</li>
