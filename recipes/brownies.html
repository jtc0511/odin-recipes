    <p class="intro">brownies are good because of their delightful chocolate flavor, moist and 
        fudgy texture, versatility, ease of preparation, quick baking time, and the 
        comfort and nostalgia they offer. Their simplicity and the joy they bring are
         what make them a beloved treat.</p>

<h2>ingrediants</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>

</ul>
<h2>directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat Your Oven: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour an 8x8-inch (20x20 cm) square baking pan or line it with parchment paper for easy removal.</li>
    <li>Melt the Butter: In a microwave-safe bowl or on the stovetop, melt the butter until it's completely liquid. Allow it to cool slightly.</li> 
    <li>Mix Sugar and Eggs: In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the granulated sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
    <li>Add Cocoa Powder: Stir in the cocoa powder and mix until the cocoa is fully incorporated into the sugar-egg mixture.</li>
    <li>Combine Dry Ingredients: In another bowl, sift together the all-purpose flour, salt, and baking powder. Gradually add these dry ingredients to the wet mixture, mixing just until combined. Be careful not to overmix; overmixing can lead to tough brownies.</li>
    <li>Add Mix-Ins (Optional): If you want to include chocolate chips, nuts, or other mix-ins, fold them into the batter at this point.</li>   
    <li>Pour and Bake: Pour the brownie batter into the prepared baking pan, spreading it evenly.</li>
    <li>Bake: Bake in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick or cake tester inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached. Be cautious not to overbake, as brownies continue to cook a bit after they're removed from the oven.</li>   
    <li>Cool: Let the brownies cool in the pan for a while before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    <li>Cut and Serve: Once they have cooled, cut the brownies into squares and serve. Enjoy your homemade brownies!</li>
